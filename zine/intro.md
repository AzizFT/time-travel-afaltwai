Welcome to my *Time Travel Zine*!  
I made this project to learn Git in a fun way by comparing it to a **time machine**.  
With Git, you can go back to older versions of your code or jump to new branches â€” kind of like traveling between timelines.  

Each commit feels like a small trip through time, and every branch is its own story.  
Just like using a real time machine, you can fix mistakes, explore new ideas, and come back to the present with better code.
