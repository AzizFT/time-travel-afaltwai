This project is a creative way to learn and practice Git.  
I’m building a small **zine (mini digital magazine)** that tells the story of a developer using a **time machine** to fix mistakes in their code by traveling between different branches in Git.

# Time Travel Zine

This project is for my Git lab.  
I added five lectures to practice using Git and learn how it works.  
The idea is that Git is like a **time machine** where each commit lets you go back in time.

## .gitignore

Some files don’t need to be tracked:
- `target/` → build files  
- `*.class` → compiled files  
- `.DS_Store` → mac file info

This keeps the repo clean.

# Editor Review

This branch is for reviewing and improving the content from the author branch.  
I’m checking the zine for grammar, layout, and better wording.  

The main goal is to make everything flow smoothly and keep the **time machine** idea clear.  
Once it looks good, I’ll merge these edits back into the main branch.

There are 3 feature branches that have been added
