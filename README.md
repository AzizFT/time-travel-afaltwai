This project is a creative way to learn and practice Git.  
I’m building a small **zine (mini digital magazine)** that tells the story of a developer using a **time machine** to fix mistakes in their code by traveling between different branches in Git.

# Time Travel Zine

This project is for my Git lab.  
I added five lectures to practice using Git and learn how it works.  
The idea is that Git is like a **time machine** where each commit lets you go back in time.

## .gitignore

Some files don’t need to be tracked:
- `target/` → build files  
- `*.class` → compiled files  
- `.DS_Store` → mac file info

This keeps the repo clean.
